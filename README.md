## Introduction

We all love shortcode that does the work. So dart has provided a great feature called Extension Methods which you can use on different data types! What are Extension Methods exactly? Extension methods add functionality to existing libraries. You might use extension methods without even knowing it. For example, when you use code completion in an IDE, it suggests extension methods alongside regular methods. [(Reference)](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods "(Reference)")

## What is this package about?
We probably use lots of extension methods in our project. So, this package combines all the extension methods that are used on daily basis and make them available to you under a single package so that you can reuse them in multiple packages.

## Getting started
